        <div class="section-2">

          <h2 id="start-run"> Start a Running Plan </h2>

          <p>
            Your running plan will depend on how fit you are. But according to <a href="https://www.fitnessmagazine.com/workout/running/running-101-a-beginners-guide/">FitnessMagazin.com</a> You can start by running for 20 minutes at a time, three times per week. Gradually increase the amount of time you're running and the number of days you run, but do not increase either until you feel comfortable completing your current level of training. If 20 minutes is too much, don't be afraid to take walking breaks. Perhaps begin by running for 4 minutes and walking for 1 minute, until you complete the 20 minutes. As you get stronger, begin eliminating the walk breaks.
          </p>
          <p>
            Your training also depends on how fit you are. In my case, I would run for as long as I can run and once I'm out of breath, I take a recovery walk.
            <br>
             A recovery walk should take 2 to 3 min. Then I would start running for 4 min. If not able to run for 4 mins then take recovery walk and then try 3 mins.
          </p>
          <p>
            Remember to train 3 to 4 times a week. Recovery days are very important for your muscle to heal and lessen injuries. Warm Up and Warm down are also important which we will talk about later on.
          <br>
            Your Training plan should look something like these
          </p>

          <h3>Running Shoes</h3>
          <p>
            The shoes you wear can make a lot of differences.
            For runners, selecting running shoes is akin to purchasing a house or a car; you’re going to spend a lot of time in them, so you want something you really like. In addition to a comfortable ride, shoes can play a major role in keeping you running strong.
          </p>
          <p>
            As you set out to find the best shoes for the job, you should first consider the shape of your feet. “Looking at a runner’s foot leads us to what type of shoe they should be in,” explained Smith.
            <br>
            The three main foot types are flat, neutral and high arches:
            <ul>
              <li>
                 Flat feet tend to have fallen arches, making them flexible and prone to overpronation, an inward rolling motion.
              </li>
              <li>
                Neutral feet are the most biomechanically sound variety, putting them somewhere in the middle.
              </li>
              <li>
                High-arched feet are essentially the polar opposite of flat feet. When the arches are particularly defined, the feet end up being rigid, leading to supination, or landing on the outside edges of the feet.
              </li>
            </ul>

          <br>
            If you're not sure about all these, I personally recommmend finding a shop dedicated to running. I live in Dublin and there are a lot of shops dedicated to running.
            <ul>
              <li> All you need to do is google it or search it on google map.</li>
              <li>Once you find the shop, go look around and ask the shop assistant to help you pick the right running shoes. </li>
              <li>I suggest pick a pair of shoe designed for long-distance running. </li>
              <li>Also consider the terrain the shoes designed for. But most long distance runners like myself; run on roads. So if you run on roads; make sure the shoes is designed for roads.</li>
            </ul>

          <br>
            In my personal experience, I went to a Sketcher shop; dedicated to all types of shoes. I told the shop assistant, that I needed a pair of running shoes for long-distance and picked the right shoes. I'm still using the shoes I bought and ran it in six long-distance road race.

          <h3 id="run-app">Running App</h3>
          <p>
            I have used and tested different running apps. As a running enthusiest and a Computer Science student I would definitely recommend <b>Running Distance Tracker</b>, one of my favourite running app I've used so far and also the most highly rated running app.
            <br>
            The App is available in:
            <ul>
              <li><a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.fitness22.running&hl=en">Android</a></li>
              <li><a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/running-distance-tracker/id1205237896?mt=8">Apple</a></li>
            </ul>
            <br>
            Also some runners use sport smart-watch or fitbit to track their running.

        <div class="section-2">
          <h2 id="warm-up">Warm Up & Cool Down</h2>
          <p>
            A warm-up is a session which takes place prior to doing physical activity; usually a warm-up will consist of light cardiovascular exercises combined with stretches.
            <br>
            <ul>
              <li> Most warm-up sessions will include a combination of cardiovascular exercises, dynamic stretching and strength drills.</li>
              <li>The cardiovascular exercises are designed to
                <ul>
                  <li>increase circulation</li>
                  <li>increase body temperature</li>
                  <li>and bring the heart rate up</li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li> ...while stretching warms the muscles and prepare them for the movements they will be required to carry out during the activity. </li>

              <li>Explosive strength exercises, which may include sprint drills or jumps.</li>
            </ul>
